# Monopoly Individual Project

Individual Monopoly Project form Comp 320

Details
- Master-Client, MVVM based Monopoly Game
- There is an initial peer creating game, and the rest join to that peer
- Application is structured as an MVVM application
    - Views are Swing Views in package `com.canerkorkmaz.monopoly.view`
    - ViewModels (in`com.canerkorkmaz.monopoly.viewmodel`) communicate with views using custom made Events and UIEvents (events run in a different background thread, ui events run in swing thread)
    - Models contain both local models and models synced through the peer network
    - Repositories are in between ViewModels and Models
- Uses a simple dependency injection system made by myself (in `com.canerkorkmaz.monopoly.lib.di`), can handle singleton dependencies, cyclic singleton dependencies and normal (factory) dependencies, however not cyclic normal dependencies (which doesn't make sense)
